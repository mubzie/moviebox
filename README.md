## Project Summary
This project exercise, was given as a task to frontend interns during my time at HNGx. The task was to create a movie website that track movies and TV shows. This project demonstrates the use of router, redirect and data-testid attribute. There is also a heavy emphasis on clean code and proper documentation.

## In Action
### Project Preview

## Future Update
- Auth: I planned to add authentication to the app so that user will be able to sign up.
- Favorite: I planned to add an interaction that will enable user to add movie or TV show as favorite. The auth implementation will serve as a way to personalize the experience.
- Bugs: There are some noticeable bugs which i'd like to also fix.

## Goal
- Greater understanding of fetching data and working with an API in a React app
- Gain better understanding of routing
- Proper code organization and documentation

## Reflection
This is my first time using react-router-dom. Before now, I haven't done anything like routing in a React app. I must confess that it was pretty difficult for me to properly understand the concept, due to the fact that the time period given for the task was very short and I need to move fast so I can get the project done before the deadline, but I did it, after countless googling, reading docs, videos and asking some experienced web developer friends. I am particularly excited learning about dynamic routing which I find pretty cool and powerful. Like every other thing, I know this project is still not perfect and there is more that can be done to improve it.
